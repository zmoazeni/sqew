        <h1>sqew (pronounced "skew")</h1>

<p>sqew is a lightweight background processor. You start a single process that will act as a queue manager and will work multiple jobs concurrently. sqew is short for "small queue" and is not meant to be an all-in-one scalable solution. sqew adopts a common enqueuing API found in other projects to make migrating to other background processors easy.</p>

<h2>When would sqew be a good fit for my project?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You don't need to split workers across multiple machines.</li>
<li>You don't want to manage multiple background worker processes, but you do want multiple jobs to run concurrently.</li>
<li>You don't want to manage an external service like Redis or Mongo to store the queue.</li>
<li>You don't want to worry about threading issues.</li>
<li>You don't want to worry about long running processes leaking memory.</li>
<li>You don't care about the enqueueing or job forking performance.</li>
<li>You don't need multiple queues (this may change soon).</li>
</ul><p>If these don't fit the bill or you need more power, I recommend you try the great other great gems such as <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/qu">Qu</a>.</p>

<h2>Rails Installation</h2>

<p>Add this line to your application's Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem sqew, :require "sqew/rails"
</code></pre>

<p>Add an initializer in <code>config/initializers/sqew.rb</code></p>

<pre><code>Sqew.configure do |config|
  config.db = "#{Rails.root}/tmp/"
  config.server = "http://0.0.0.0:8884"
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>db</code> config will be a directory where sqew will manage its databases, and the <code>server</code> config is what what the worker will connect at as well as where the application will post jobs to.</p>

<p>Once you have sqew configured, you can start the queue manager by running <code>rake sqew:work</code>. This will manage the queues, it'll act as a server where the application post jobs, and it will work the jobs as the arrive.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Add this line to your application's Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem sqew
</code></pre>

<p>And then execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install sqew
</code></pre>

<h2>The Sqew Manager</h2>

<p>The Sqew manager is a JSON API for inspecting the queue, pushing work onto the queue, and manipulating the queue and workers. Actions you can perform are:</p>

<pre><code># enqueue a job
# Sqew.push(TheJobClass, 1, 2, 3)
POST /enqueue
  {"job":"TheJobClass", "args":[1, 2, 3]}

# ping the server to programatically see if it is alive
# Sqew.ping
GET /ping

# get the status of the queue, running jobs, failed jobs, and how many workers the server will use
# Sqew.status
GET /status

# dynamically change the number of workers (processes) the manager will use
# Sqew.workers = 10 (the default is 3)
PUT /workers
  "10"

# clear the entire queue
# Sqew.clear
DELETE /clear

# clear just the failed jobs
# Sqew.clear("failed")
DELETE /clear
  failed

# delete a specific job by id
# Sqew.delete(11)
DELETE /11
</code></pre>

<h2>Enqueuing jobs</h2>

<p>From your application you will create jobs just like <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/qu">Qu</a> in the form of</p>

<pre><code>class MyJob
  def perform(arg1, arg2)
    # .. the job code
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And the manager will receive the job and start working on it when it can. You can enqueue the job from Sqew:</p>

<pre><code>Sqew.push(MyJob, 1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using Rails 4 you can enqueue the job by using the Rails queuing API:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.queue.push(MyJob, 1, 2)
</code></pre>

<h2>Is it any good?</h2>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434">Yes.</a></p>

<h2>Where does sqew store its data?</h2>

<p>Sqew doesn't use redis or your rails database. It uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a> to manage its persistence. So you don't have to manage/setup anything.</p>

<h2>Does it work on windows?</h2>

<p>No. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(operating_system)">forking</a> heavily.</p>

<h2>TODO Soon</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reusable God/Bluepil/Monit config for managing the worker</li>
<li>Capistrano plugin for restarting the worker on deploy</li>
<li>Javascript browser front-end for the manager</li>
<li>Multiple queues with weight (possibly)</li>
